# Typert remote calls

English | [中文](typert.zh.md)

Types shared by generated Remote artifacts, the Host Gateway, and consumer API assemblies. The [Typert Gateway Agent Note](../../.agents/notes/implemented/architecture/2026-08-02-typert-remote-method-calls.md) owns the architecture and transport decisions; this page records the literal public contracts from [`dsh-typert-protocol`](../../packages/typert/protocol/src/types.ts) and [`dsh-api-gateway`](../../packages/api/gateway/src/types.ts).

## Lookup and Context declarations

Business-object packages extend two empty maps through declaration merging. A lookup associates one Host object type with its wire identity; a Context declaration associates one scoped Context kind with its wire identity. Generated descriptors name these keys, while runtime providers supply the live resolution behavior.

```ts type-equiv
/** Merge-extensible Host object lookup declarations. */
interface TypertLookupMap {}
```

```ts type-equiv
/** Merge-extensible scoped Context declarations. */
interface TypertContextMap {}
```

The registry retains a lookup's wire declaration after its resolver unloads. SRC discovery therefore continues to classify the parameter as a lookup and fails unavailable instead of accepting the wire value as an ordinary business object.

```ts type-equiv
/** Stable wire declaration retained after a lookup provider unloads. */
interface TypertLookupDefinition {
  /** Merge-declared lookup key. */
  readonly key: string
  /** Source parameter name recognized by the SRC weak parser. */
  readonly parameter: string
  /** Wire field replacing the Host object parameter. */
  readonly wire: string
  /** Canonical Host type symbol used by strict generation. */
  readonly hostTypeSymbol: string
  /** Canonical wire type symbol used by strict generation. */
  readonly wireTypeSymbol: string
}
```

## Invocation descriptors

An `InvocationDescriptor` is local reflection, not a wire message. Host and consumer builds generate corresponding descriptors; the request sends only the endpoint and named `args`. Every `@Remote(options)` and `@RemoteScope(key, options)` declaration supplies an options object: `access: 'authenticated'` selects identity-only access, while `permission` selects permission access. Bare decorators and string aliases are invalid. An authenticated descriptor requires a valid Host-issued call but has no `authorization` metadata and does not inject the call into the business method. A permission descriptor carries `authorization`; its Host method declares a non-optional first `call: AuthenticatedCall`, which generation removes from the Client signature and wire `args`.

`access` is a required closed discriminant. Generation, loading, and registration reject a missing or unknown value, an authenticated descriptor with `authorization`, or a permission descriptor without matching authorization metadata. Strict descriptors and live markers must also agree on access, permission, endpoint alias, and direct or scoped invocation. Gateway validates the Host-issued call before inspecting arguments, and permission authorization completes before exact argument validation, business lookup-provider resolution, and RemoteScope Context identity, Context, or scoped-receiver resolution. The allow decision is checked again immediately before invocation. No invalid descriptor or withdrawn strict definition falls back to authenticated or SRC execution. Cancellation remains an out-of-band carrier signal injected after business parameters and never enters `args`.

```ts type-equiv
/** Codec attached to one invocation parameter or result. */
type TypertCodec =
  | {
    readonly mode: 'strict'
    readonly typeSymbol: string
    readonly schema: TypertSchema
  }
  | {
    readonly mode: 'src-json'
  }
```

```ts type-equiv
/** One ordered business parameter in a Remote invocation. */
interface InvocationParameterDescriptor {
  /** Source-level parameter name. */
  readonly name: string
  /** Required key in the wire `args` object. */
  readonly wire: string
  /** Whether the value is JSON or requires a registered Host lookup. */
  readonly source: 'json' | 'lookup'
  /** Lookup key when `source` is `lookup`. */
  readonly lookup?: string
  /** Boundary codec for the wire representation. */
  readonly codec: TypertCodec
  /** Missing wire fields decode to `undefined` only for an explicitly declared `T | undefined`. */
  readonly acceptsUndefined?: true
}
```

```ts type-equiv
/** Carrier-independent description of one exported method invocation. */
type InvocationDescriptor = InvocationDescriptorBase & (
  | {
    /** A valid Host-issued authenticated call is sufficient. */
    readonly access: 'authenticated'
    readonly authorization?: never
  }
  | {
    /** Product authorization is required before dispatch. */
    readonly access: 'permission'
    /** Host-only authorization and call-context injection. */
    readonly authorization: {
      /** Product permission required before argument validation or lookup. */
      readonly permission: string
      /** Reserved first Host parameter omitted from the wire and Client signature. */
      readonly callParameter: 'call'
    }
  }
)
```

## Typert registry

`ctx.typert` separates current-environment descriptors, explicitly selected Remote contributions, lookup providers, and scoped Context providers. A lookup provider owns the stable wire declaration and default resolver; Host composition can configure an effect-scoped synchronous or asynchronous resolver for the same key, and unloading that configuration restores the default policy. Registrations are Cordis-owned effects and return awaitable disposers.

```ts type-equiv
/** Minimal Typert runtime consumed through dependency inversion. */
interface TypertRegistryContract {
  readonly local: TypertLocalRegistry
  readonly remotes: TypertRemoteRegistry
  readonly lookups: TypertLookupRegistry
  readonly contexts: TypertContextRegistry
}
```

Generated consumer declarations merge direct namespaces into the map inherited by `TypertClientRemote`.

```ts type-equiv
/** Merge-extensible direct namespace surface generated for Client Remote services. */
interface TypertRemoteNamespaceMap {}
```

## Host Gateway

Connection decodes its carrier envelope before calling `ctx.typertGateway`. The request carries exact named wire fields and the authenticated call and cancellation signal separately; infrastructure and boundary failures use the Gateway's in-process error taxonomy, ordinary exceptions are folded by the RPC adapter into the transport's `internal` error code, and existing RPC errors carried by lookup policy through `TypertLookupFailure` are returned unchanged.

```ts type-equiv
/** One Remote method request after a carrier has decoded its envelope. */
interface InvokeRemoteRequest {
  /** Host-issued caller identity supplied out of band and never decoded from `args`. */
  readonly call: AuthenticatedCall
  /** Remote namespace selected by the generated descriptor. */
  readonly namespace: string
  /** Exported Service method name. */
  readonly method: string
  /** Named wire values; fields must exactly match the descriptor. */
  readonly args: Readonly<Record<string, unknown>>
}
```

```ts type-equiv
/** Stable infrastructure and boundary failures emitted before or after business execution. */
type TypertGatewayErrorCode =
  | 'ambiguous-endpoint'
  | 'arguments-invalid'
  | 'binding-invalid'
  | 'context-failed'
  | 'context-not-found'
  | 'context-unavailable'
  | 'definition-unavailable'
  | 'input-invalid'
  | 'invocation-unavailable'
  | 'lookup-failed'
  | 'lookup-not-found'
  | 'lookup-unavailable'
  | 'method-unavailable'
  | 'provider-mismatch'
  | 'result-invalid'
  | 'service-unavailable'
  | 'signature-invalid'
```

```ts type-equiv
/** Host dispatcher consumed by Connection adapters. */
interface TypertGateway {
  /**
   * Invoke one live Remote method without assuming a carrier or response envelope.
   * @param request - decoded endpoint and named wire arguments.
   * @returns the validated business result.
   * @throws {@link TypertGatewayError} for dispatch, provider, or boundary failures; lookup-policy and business errors retain identity.
   */
  invoke(request: InvokeRemoteRequest): Promise<unknown>
}
```

## Consumer Remote

`ctx.remote` exposes only namespaces contributed by imported `/remote` artifacts. `$mount()` installs generated descriptors and concrete methods as one fiber-owned operation. Each namespace is a traced `remote.<namespace>` Cordis child Service whose lifetime spans its mounted methods; no JavaScript Proxy or Host business Service type enters the consumer.

```ts type-equiv
/** Client Remote capability implemented by the Gateway and consumed by Remote assemblies. */
interface TypertClientRemote extends TypertRemoteNamespaceMap {
  /**
   * Mount one generated Host-for-Client contribution in the caller's fiber.
   * @param contribution - explicitly selected Remote package artifact.
   * @returns disposer after namespace services and concrete methods are ready.
   */
  $mount(contribution: TypertRemoteContribution): Promise<TypertDisposer>
  /**
   * Subscribe to one forwarded Host event; delivery is one-way, in registration
   * order, and isolates a throwing listener from the rest.
   * @template Event - forwarded event name selected by the Host assembly.
   * @param event - forwarded Host event name, unchanged on the wire.
   * @param listener - receives the Host's argument list as declared by Cordis `Events`.
   * @returns disposer owned by the calling fiber.
   */
  $on<Event extends TypertRemoteEvent>(event: Event, listener: Events[Event]): () => void
  /**
   * Hand one decoded forwarded frame to the subscription table. The carrier
   * owning the Host frame sink calls this; a consumer subscribes with
   * {@link TypertClientRemote.$on} and never calls it.
   *
   * `event` is a plain string because this is the wire boundary: the name is
   * whatever the Host assembly's allowlist selected, and one nobody subscribed
   * to is dropped silently.
   * @param event - forwarded Host event name, exactly as the Host emitted it.
   * @param args - the Host argument list, already JSON-decoded.
   */
  $dispatch(event: string, args: readonly unknown[]): void
}
```

## Cordis API

Generated from source by `scripts/gen-cordis-catalog.ts` (verified fresh by `pnpm run verify-cordis-catalog` in doc-sync; regenerate with `pnpm run gen-cordis-catalog`) — this section is byte-identical in both language sides of the page. Signature blocks use a `ts cordis-catalog` fence and keep the original source JSDoc; dispatch modes are defined in the [primer](../cordis-primer.md#dispatch-modes), and the framework-inherited `ctx` API lives in [cordis-api/inherited.md](../cordis-api/inherited.md).
